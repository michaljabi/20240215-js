# Explain the `.md` file:

> Thi is a special file, where we can format the text.


## For example:

I can type here something, and for _Notepad_ program, it will be just a `text`, with some **wierd characters around it**. 
But if you open it with: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
You can see a _"preview"_ with a formatting!

Those files are used widely as a documentation for **programming projects**.

Most commonly used for describing a project is the: `README.md` file.

### This is not a "programming" yet ðŸ˜…

For your convenience, most of the _explanations_ for the `code` will be placed directly inside `.js` files. But sometimes - I will use `.md` files to describe something.  

It has cool formatting for the code:

```javascript
const example = 'see ?';
console.log(example);
```
 
### NOTE:  
Services like [Github.com](https://github.com/) where you will keep your code, understand the `.md` syntax, and will format the _Markup Document_. 

Example:
[jQuery repository on Github](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), below the list of files you will see the formatted `README.md` file on website.
