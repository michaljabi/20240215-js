# Explain the _Command Line_:
   
Modern _Front-End Developer_ uses `console` on a daily basis, running commands connected with `Node.js` environment.

Despite `Node.js` is a "server-side" environment, which suppose to be reserved for _Back-End Developers_ only, that is not true when comes to _development process_.

Both _Front_ and _Back_ _-Ends_ uses node for _development_ and on _Back-End_ `Node.js` is an runtime environment, whereas on _Front-End_ the `Browser` is.

> Because of that, you need to get familiar with command line.

There are many tools that run on `Node.js` when you develop your app. They are so called `CLI`s (Command Line Interfaces).

## Basics:

- you will need to know what terminal is.
- how to run it
- how to type in commands
- where am I? In context of current system path.


### How to start using terminal?

Every operating system have a kind of _Command line_, and you can connect to it, and run commands with a _Terminal_. It has access to various commands, and file system. 

The basic function of command line is to explore the file system, folders and files. 

_Terminals_ got different names, depend on _OS_ (Operating System). In Windows, you got two main terminals installed:

- PowerShell
- cmd (Command)

You can simpy run each of them using keyboard combination: `[Win] + [R]` or `[Win] + [S]` simply typing in:
`cmd` and confirm or `powershell` and confirm.


### Can I simplify this?

> Yes, on _day-to-day_ work, you will use terminal from your _Code Editor_ (which is in fact a wrapper for PowerShell or CMD in system).

All you will have to do is find in top menu of _Visual Studio Code_ option:  
- _Terminal_ > _New Terminal_

That's it !
