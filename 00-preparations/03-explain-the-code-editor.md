# Explain the _Code Editor_ 
       
> You need to understand that: file, where you write the code is JUST A _Text file_.  
> That means - you can open it and write it in system **_Notepad_** program.

but: we do not want to use _Notepad_ to write _JavaScript_ programs!
                                                                       
You need to have _color syntax_, build in _terminal_, helpful _refactoring_ (code reorganization) features, `git` integration.

That is why: as a **Developer** - you choose a **Code Editor**.

## Many possibilities out there:
             
Just like you have many programs to run `.txt`, `.mp3`, `.jpg` etc. files, there are many possibilities. We will just focus on 1 of them:

- **Visual Studio Code** - it is now, the best _free (open source)_ option to start. 
                        
## Having "The project":

Project in _JavaScript_ is just a bunch of files and folders connected with the _Web Development_. That means, despite `.js` files and folders, you will have some `.html`, `.css` and some binary files like: `.jpg`, `.ico` and other media - supported by the browser.

Generally you got one main directory (folder) with a project, and all of mentioned files above inside.

The basic role of your Code Editor (Visual Studio Code in our case) will be opening this main folder as a project. You will use the main menu option:

- _File_ > _Open Folder..._
           

Select folder containing all of those files and start working....
