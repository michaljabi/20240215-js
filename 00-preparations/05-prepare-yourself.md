# Prepare yourself:
   
To minimize effort for run code and maximize focus on how it works,
we will use additional tools, with `Node.js`.

To see, how Interpreter works - and how our code is running, line by line:  
- we will use: [JavaScript REPL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=achil.vscode-javascript-repl), this is a _VSC extension_.
- It works when you got `Node` installed. 
- You can run code by just _right-clicking_ on the file, and choose `JS Repl: run`  

That will cause, additional information to show up alongside with your code. 
Those notifications are from _JavaScript_ runtime, so you can see what is _executed_ e.g., on the `console.log`. You will see how many times particular line of code, was visited and executed by Interpreter.

This kind of information, will be helpful for your learning process. You will save time, when there will be no need to run each file from the terminal again and again after each code change.
